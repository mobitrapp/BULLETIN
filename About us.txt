Spearhead Media Pvt. Ltd.</b><br /><br />Spearhead Media Pvt. Ltd., a young but dynamic media house, that has its office at Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mangaluru and Dubai in the Middle East, brings to you the best way to keep in touch with Karnataka and the world, on the go.<br/><br/> 
Humble start<br/><br/> 
 
With the vision of 'Educate, Enlighten, Empower and Enable positive changes', newskarnataka.com, was started in  
 
May 2012 in Kannada. However, the response to the website and the quest to diversity prompted the team to  
 
start an English news portal in March 17, 2013, thus bringing into existence two exclusive portals - 
 
newskarnataka.com, catering to English readers and newskannada.com, dedicated to Kannada reader base. 
 
Since then there has been no looking back. With indeed a humble beginning, we stand here in the resplendent  
 
arena of media contributing in a small yet powerful way towards promoting positive and ethical journalism.</b><br/><br/>
Passion rules!<br/><br/> 
 
Unlike many media organization, which are profit and digits-driven, we at newskarnataka.com proudly proclaim  
 
that the portal was born out of passion and not out of commercial interest. 
 
Newskarnataka.com could undoubtedly be first of its kind undertaking, which has done away with 'single  
 
ownership' concept and has successfully worked out a amicable model of working without any individual's'  
 
interest. We have sustained and we are happy with the success of this model, which says  
 
that newskakrnataka.com belongs to all-readers, writers, contributors, employees and each and every person who  
 
connects to it. Probably that is the reason behind our 'fearless journalism' where our journalist strongly say what  
 
they want to say, without being silenced by the management or anyone else.</b><br/><br/>
New foray<br/><br/> 
 
On November 5, 2015, Spearhead Media, the mother organization of Newskarnataka.com diversified and ventured  
 
into yet another avenue of media-the print, by launching its ambitious monthly magazine 'Karnataka Today'. 
 
The magazine headed by veteran journalist A Ram Babu has already caught the eyes of the readers with its
 
superior print quality, aesthetic layout and most importantly, relevant, unbiased and extensive coverage of issues  
 
impacting India in general and Karnataka in particular.</b><br/><br/>
